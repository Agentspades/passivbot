Do you want me to:
1) Create a single commit that stages and commits all unstaged changes with one combined commit message, or
2) Create separate commits for each changed file (one commit per file) with autogenerated messages like "Update <file_path>"?

Also:
- Should I include untracked files (stage new files) or only stage modified tracked files?
- If you prefer separate commits, should the autogenerated message format be "Update <file_path>" or something else?

Reply with your preference (e.g. "single, include untracked" or "separate, exclude untracked, message=Update").
